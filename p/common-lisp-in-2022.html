  <h1>Common Lisp in 2022</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Positives</h3>
    <h4>Low Syntax</h4>
    <p>
      I often get distracted and overwhelmed when I need to memorize a bunch of syntax right away.
      Its 1 of the many reasons I have problems Haskell. 
    </p>
    <h4>Homoiconicity</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">Homoiconicity</a> simply means that code and data are the same thing.
      It took me a while to get how useful a concept this is.
      Combining this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">Referential transparency</a> enables me to easily reason about programs.
      
    </p>
    <h4>Small Community</h4>
    <p>
      This can be a bit of a double-edged sword, but I generally consider it a positive.
      It means that pretty much anyone using it wants to be using it.
      It also means that many of the users are much more generally experienced in programming than a more common language.
      The main disadvantages are the number of libraries available and the available learning resources.
    </p>
    <h4>Stability</h4>
    <p>
      The Common Lisp spec is fucking old and even if magically a knew spec is created, I'm betting on my old code still working.
      This also has the advantage that code older than a few years will probably still work just fine.
      To see why that is important, look at Python (just as 1 example among many, if you love Python).
      Even ignoring the move from Python2 to Python3, differing versions break things surprisingly quickly.
      You do need to pay attention to which implementation of Common Lisp that the code was written for.
      They are all broadly the same, but its all the little differences that fuck you.
    </p>
    <h4>Its REPL</h4>
    <p>
      I am using Emacs and <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/sly">sly</a> as my dev environment.
      Out of the box, its really nice and reasonably intuitive.
      I can just hit ctrl-c ctrl-k, and ta-dah the current buffer is compiled and loaded into the running lisp instance.  
      You can also quickly just compile and load a region,

      <h4>Cool Weird Features</h4>
      <h5>Lisp Images</h5>
      <p>
        A lisp image is pretty much a core dump of a running instance of lisp.
        It's most obvious benefit is that you can run a very expensive computation once and then just save the image.
        Then you can just reload the image and bippity boopity, you can just use the result of the computation.
        <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/manual/#Saving-a-Core-Image">SBCL Manual</a>
      </p>
      <h5>Macros</h5>
      <p>
        If there is a feature known about lisps, its their macros.
        There just code that produces more code.
        But goddamn are they powerful.

      <h4>Cool shit written in Common Lisp</h4>
      <h5><a href="https://github.com/orthecreedence/wookie">Wookie</a></h5>
      <p>
        Wookie had some of the lowest latency I have ever seen on a website.
        However, its site has gone down since I first looked at it.

    <h3>Negatives</h3>
    <h4>Format</h4>
    <p>
      It is real esoteric and cryptic as fuck.
      Why are there so many tildes?
