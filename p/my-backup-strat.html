    <h3>Options</h3>
    <h4>Programs</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><div>Rclone+My Own Script</div></li>
      <li><div>ZFS</div></li>
      <li><div>BorgBackup</div></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Providers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a>
          No base storage requirement
          $0.005 per GB per Month
          $0.01 per GB Download
          So for 100GB per year with 1 full restore, it would be $6 USD for storage and $1 dollar for download
          Definitely the cheapest option
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="https://www.rsync.net/pricing.html">Rsync.net(ZFS)</a>
          400 GB base requirement
          $120 USD per year for the base requirement
          A bit excessive for my use
          I've also seen some issues with encrypted send and receive, which I would need
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html">Rsync.net(BorgBackup)</a>
          I trust their support more than B2
          I'm not trying to dis B2, I can just tell from Rsync's site that Unix nerds are their target audience
          No Ingress XOR Egress fees
          100 GB base requirement
          $18 USD per year for the base requirement
        </div>

    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <h4>Main</h4>
    <p>
      I use BorgBackup to Rsync.net.
      I am shocked by the amount compression and deduplication reduces storage space used.
      I had around 40 GB raw data, and it shrinks down to 7 GB actually stored.
      I am still working out some kinks in my script.
      Sometimes Borg just hangs on a file and I have no idea why.
      I noticed it on a plain text config file.
      It also seems to have issues with large folders, for example my home dir.
      And I do have excludes for local caches and the like.
      I get around it for now with more granular archives.
    </p>
    <h4>Local NAS</h4>
    <p>
      I don't currently have a NAS, because I am moving and I don't want more stuff that I need to shuffle around.
      I am looking at grabbing a thin client after I get settled in to my new place.
      Yes, it won't have ECC memory, but at my price point nothing would.
      I am thinking that I will use 1 VDEV at RaidZ3, so 1 drive can die out of 3.
      I am planning on 2 TB drives to give me some good breathing room.
    </p>
    <h4>Rclone to B2 from Rsync.net</h4>
    <p>
      The main reason is to save my own bandwidth.
      They will also have much more throughput then me.
      They have s3cmd installed locally as well, and I imagine that can interface with B2 just fine.
